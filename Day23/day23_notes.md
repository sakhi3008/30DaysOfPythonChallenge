# 🗓️ Day 23 – Building a GUI with Kivy

In today’s challenge, I transformed a temperature converter CLI tool into a GUI-based app using **Kivy**. Kivy is a powerful and flexible Python framework for building multitouch applications. It supports multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS) and is designed for natural user interfaces.

## 🔹 Topics Covered

### 🔸 What is Kivy?

Kivy is an open-source Python library used to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and multi-touch applications. It's cross-platform and supports desktop as well as mobile devices.

* **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
* **Touch support**: Ideal for touch applications.
* **Customizable UI**: Highly flexible and supports both code-based and KV language-based layouts.

### 🔸 Creating Basic GUI Elements in Kivy

Widgets are the building blocks of a Kivy GUI. They are used to interact with users or display information.

#### Commonly Used Widgets:

* `BoxLayout`: Arranges child widgets in vertical or horizontal boxes.
* `Label`: Used to display static text.
* `Button`: Responds to click events.
* `TextInput`: Allows users to enter and edit text.
* `Spinner`: A dropdown menu for selecting an option from a list.

These widgets help you quickly design a clean and structured user interface.

### 🔸 Event Handling and Widget Interactions

Kivy applications follow an **event-driven** programming model. You can bind actions (like clicking a button) to functions.

#### Examples:

* `button.bind(on_press=self.convert)`: Runs the `convert()` method when the button is clicked.
* You can use `.text` property of widgets like `TextInput`, `Label`, or `Spinner` to read or update their values dynamically.

This model makes it easy to create interactive applications where user input affects the interface.

### 🔸 Useful Kivy Methods and Properties for Beginners

| Method / Property       | Description                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `App.run()`             | Starts the main application loop                       |
| `add_widget(widget)`    | Adds a child widget to a layout                        |
| `bind(event, function)` | Binds a function to an event like a button press       |
| `TextInput.text`        | Gets or sets the input text                            |
| `Label.text`            | Sets text for a label dynamically                      |
| `Spinner.text`          | Gets or sets the selected item                         |
| `BoxLayout.orientation` | Controls layout direction ('vertical' or 'horizontal') |
| `padding` and `spacing` | Used for layout spacing and visual alignment           |

Understanding these methods will give you better control over how your app looks and behaves.

## 🎯 Challenge – Convert CLI Tool into GUI App

In this challenge, I:

* Designed a user-friendly GUI using `BoxLayout`
* Collected temperature input from the user using `TextInput`
* Let the user choose a conversion direction using `Spinner`
* Triggered the conversion using a `Button`
* Displayed the result in a `Label`
* Used `try-except` to handle invalid inputs gracefully

### 👨‍🎓 What I Learned:

* How to transform CLI logic into GUI applications
* The role and behavior of different Kivy widgets
* Event-driven programming using `.bind()`
* Creating responsive and user-friendly layouts

Kivy makes it easier to create cross-platform, interactive GUI apps. It’s a great tool for developers interested in app design, user interface development, or building touch-based applications.
