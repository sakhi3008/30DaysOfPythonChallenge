                "answer": "Polymorphism means the ability to take multiple forms. Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as if they are instances of the same class through a common interface. This means that a method in a parent class can be overridden by a method with the same name in a child class, but the child class can provide its own specific implementation. This allows the same method to operate differently depending on the object that invokes it. Polymorphism is about overriding, not overloading; it enables methods to operate on objects of different classes, which can have their own attributes and methods, providing flexibility and reusability in the code.",

Generally, Python only uses only one thread to execute the set of written statements. The performance of the single-threaded process and the multi-threaded process will be the same in Python and this is because of GIL in Python. We can not achieve multithreading in Python because we have a global interpreter lock that restricts the threads and works as a single thread.",
