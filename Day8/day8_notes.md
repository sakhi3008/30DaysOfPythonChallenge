# 🗓️ Day 08 – OOP Part 1: Classes, Objects, Attributes & Methods 🚗

## 🧠 Core Concepts in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

### 🔹 Class
A **class** is a blueprint or template to create objects. It defines what data (attributes) and behavior (methods) an object can have.

### 🔹 Object
An **object** is an actual instance created from a class. It holds real data based on the class structure.

### 🔹 Attributes
**Attributes** are the variables that belong to an object. They represent the object's state (e.g., brand, model, color).

### 🔹 Methods
**Methods** are functions defined inside a class that describe the behavior of an object. They usually work with the object’s attributes.

## ✅ What I Did in the Code

### 1. Defined a Class
I created a class named `Car` to represent car details.

### 2. Used `__init__()` Constructor
This method automatically runs when an object is created. It assigns the values for brand, model, and color to the new car object.

### 3. Created a Method (`display`)
This method prints the car’s details using formatted output.

### 4. Created an Object
I made an object called `my_car` using the `Car` class and passed values like `"Mercedes-Benz"`, `"C-Class"`, and `"Obsidian Black"`.

### 5. Called the Method
I used `my_car.display()` to show the car’s brand, model, and color.

## 📌 Summary

This challenge helped me understand the **foundation of object-oriented programming**:
- Classes are blueprints.
- Objects are actual items built from those blueprints.
- Attributes store object data.
- Methods define object behavior.

It’s the first step toward building organized, scalable, and reusable Python code using OOP.
