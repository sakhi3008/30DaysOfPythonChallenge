# üóìÔ∏è Day 02 ‚Äì Rectangle Area Calculator (Multiple Approaches)

In this challenge, I explored **7 different ways** to calculate the area of a rectangle by taking user input for length and width. Each method helped me understand a new Python concept or technique.

## üß† Concepts Used and What I Learned

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ User Input and Data Types
- I used the `input()` function to get values from the user.
- Since `input()` returns text (string), I converted it to `float` to handle decimal values.
- Learned how to take user input safely and process it for calculations.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Variables
- Stored the length, width, and area in variables.
- Understood how to name and assign values to variables.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Functions
- Created a function to calculate area. This made the code reusable and clean.
- Learned the structure of defining and calling functions in Python.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Lambda Functions
- Explored how to write a function in one line using `lambda`.
- Useful for small tasks but not ideal for complex logic.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ `map()` and `split()` for Input
- Learned how to take multiple inputs in a single line.
- `split()` divides the input into separate values, and `map()` applies a function (like `float`) to each of them.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Dictionaries
- Stored the rectangle‚Äôs dimensions using key-value pairs.
- Practiced using dictionaries to organize related data meaningfully.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Built a simple class `Rectangle` with properties and a method to calculate area.
- Learned about constructors (`__init__`) and how to create and use objects.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling
- Used `try-except` to catch invalid inputs (like letters instead of numbers).
- Learned how to make code more user-friendly and prevent it from crashing.

## üìå Summary

This challenge was more than just calculating area ‚Äî it was about learning different **ways to structure a program** in Python. I now have a better understanding of:
- How to take and process input
- How to write reusable functions
- The basics of object-oriented programming
- Handling errors gracefully
- Using collections like dictionaries
- Writing shorter code using lambda and map()

Every method helped me explore a new Python concept while solving the same problem in a new way. üêçüí°
