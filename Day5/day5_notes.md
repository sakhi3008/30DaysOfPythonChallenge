# 🗓️ Day 05 – Sum and Average of a List

## 🧩 Challenge:
Write a function to compute the **sum** and **average** of a list of numbers using different methods.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

### 🔹 1. Functions
- Defined reusable functions using `def`.
- Returned multiple values using tuple unpacking: `return total, average`.

### 🔹 2. Built-in Functions
- Used Python’s built-in `sum()` to calculate total easily.
- Used `len()` to count the number of items for average calculation.

### 🔹 3. Lambda Functions
- Defined a lambda expression: `lambda x, y: x + y` to add two numbers.
- Applied it inside a loop to manually rebuild `sum()` functionality.

### 🔹 4. Conditional Logic
- Used a simple `if` condition to avoid division by zero when calculating average.

## 📌 Summary

This challenge helped reinforce:
- Working with **lists**
- Understanding **how built-in functions work under the hood**
- Using **lambda functions** for custom logic
- Writing **clean, reusable** code with proper return values

Two different approaches — one using Python's simplicity, and another to understand what's happening behind the scenes.
